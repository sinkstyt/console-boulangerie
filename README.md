#### Note on Commit Gap
between commit "add and pass Pastry construct spec" committed at Fri Feb 26 12:27:10 2021 -0500 and the next at Fri Feb 26 15:37:46 2021 -0500, I was researching ASCII encoding and abstract classes in order to provide a bit of ASCII art to the inroductory menu as well as a greeting and a public asbstract method Greet(). Also researched during this time: overloaded constructors and the resources available at [Dot Net Perls](https://www.dotnetperls.com/). All in pursuit (ultimately) for finding that ONE error in my syntax in the body of my constructor(!)
